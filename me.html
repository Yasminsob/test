    <h4>hi (again), i'm yasmin and i was born and raised in saudi arabia, <br>
        now studying design & technology at parsons school of design in new york city.<br>
         i took a gap year before diving into my studies, which has broadened my perspective on art and technology. <br>
        i enjoy crocheting and am equally passionate about performance and digital arts. <br>
        thanks for checking out my website!
